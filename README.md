# Admissions Screening process

## Feature generation
Feature generation used to be done in R using the `dbUtilities` package developed by Suvam Paul and Jacqueline Gutman (see [our deprecated README](README_old.md)) but is now done predominantly in the research database directly. For detailed documentation on the structure of these tables and how they are generated, see documentation in the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B__nBZCrcLwjc2t4eU5pd0V3RGM) for this project, specifically our [data dictionary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OnS4kOclTdohz-5x7vS5auKelp7B4DySRKl6F-EU3cI/edit?usp=sharing) and [view construction specification](https://docs.google.com/a/med.nyu.edu/document/d/1OWY1iZsXPYPBHA8oou08APH5wQGFfYNZPpK1K7bTF_w/edit?usp=sharing).
